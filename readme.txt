Add an Additional Administrative Fee Percentage to your cart.

== Description ==
Some products take a bit more work to prepare and or ship. This plugin will allow you to associate an additional administrative fee percentage with a product. Once this product is added to a cart, the fee percentage is applied to the cart total. If you add more than one product that is associated with an additional administrative fee, then the total percentage will be applied to the cart total.
